- en: Now it is time to pick up the pace. You are doing a lot of printing to get you
    familiar with typing simple things, but those simple things are fairly boring.
    What we want to do now is get data into your programs. This is a little tricky
    because you have to learn to do two things that may not make sense right away,
    but trust me and do them anyway. They will make sense in a few exercises.

    input from a person. You may not even know what “input” means, but type this code
    in anyway and make it exactly the same. In the next exercise we’ll do more to
    explain input.

    end the line with a newline character and go to the next line.

    but try `x =` `int(input())`, which gets the number as a string from `input()`
    and then converts it to an integer using `int()`.'

    You don’t put your height in there; you type it directly into your Terminal. First
    thing is, go back and make the code exactly like mine. Next, run the script, and
    when it pauses, type your height in at your keyboard. That’s all there is to it.'
