    book right. Are you trying to use IDLE or an IDE? I said not to use one in [Exercise
    0](intro.xhtml#intro), so you should not use one. If you skipped [Exercise 0](intro.xhtml#intro),

    learning how to install Jupyter, run Jupyter, run the Terminal, and work with
    both of them. If you haven’t done that, then do not proceed. You will not have
    a good time. This is the only time I’ll start an exercise with a warning that
    you should not skip or get ahead of yourself.

    be close though. You may have a slightly different window header, maybe slightly
    different colors, and the left side of your Jupyter window won’t be the same,
    but will instead show the directory you used for saving your files. All of those
    differences are fine.

    numbers into Python scripts.

    same as what I have in the cell. Exactly means exactly, not kind of sort of the
    same. Every single character has to match for it to work. Color doesn’t matter,
    only the characters you type.

    you did it right, then you should see the same output as I in the *What You Should
    See* section of this exercise. If not, you have done something wrong. No, the
    computer is not wrong.

    the missing `"` (double-quote) character the end though?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5\. Finally, it prints out a “SyntaxError” and tells us something about what
    might be the error. Usually these errors are very cryptic, but if you copy that
    text into a search engine, you will find someone else who’s had that error, and
    you can probably figure out how to fix it.

    you can also create a `python` file in Jupyter and get a “good enough” editor.
    In the left panel where you see all your files, click the `+` (plus) icon on the
    top left. That will bring you to the first screen you saw when you started Jupyter.
    Down at the bottom under `$_ Other` you’ll see a button for `Python` `File` with
    the Python logo. Click that and you’ll get an editor to work on your file.'
