- en: Now we’ll do even more typing of variables and printing them out. This time
    we’ll use something called a “format string.” Every time you put `"` (double-quotes)
    around a piece of text you have been making a *string*. A string is how you make
    something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings
    to files, send strings to web servers, and many other things.

- en: Strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings
    that have variables embedded in them. You embed variables inside a string by using
    a special `{}` sequence and then put the variable you want inside the `{}` characters.
    You also must start the string with the letter `f` for “format,” as in `f"Hello
    {somevar}"`. This little `f` before the `"` (double-quote) and the `{}` characters
    tell Python 3, “Hey, this string needs to be formatted. Put these variables in
    there.”

    the same.

    sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used `=` to set them.

    and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.

- en: '**Can I make a variable like this:** `1 = ''Zed Shaw''`**?** No, `1` is not
    a valid variable name. They need to start with a character, so `a1` would work,
    but `1` will not.'

    your measurements. It’s weird, but talking about yourself will make it seem more
    real. Also, you’re just starting out, so it won’t make too much sense. Keep going
    and more exercises will explain it more.'
