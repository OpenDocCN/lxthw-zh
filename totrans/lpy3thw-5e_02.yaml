    computer to run Python. You should follow these instructions as exactly as possible.
    If you have problems following the written instructions, then watch the included
    videos for your platform.

    to write code. Nearly every programmer has their own specialized environment,
    but at first you’ll want something simple that can get you through this course.
    After the course you’ll know enough about programming to then waste the rest of
    your life trying every tool you can imagine. It’s a lot of fun.

    book to get you started easily. Jupyter is a programming and data analysis environment
    that uses many languages, but we’ll use Python.

- en: • Python. The version of Python you install *mostly* doesn’t matter so long
    as it’s older than version 3.6\. Versions of Python (and other software) use numbers
    to indicate their age, and the position of the numbers determines how much changed
    between versions. The general rule is the first number means “major change,” the
    second number means “minor changes,” and a third number means only bug or security
    fixes. That means if you have version 3.8 and version 3.10, then there are no
    major changes, but there are minor changes. If you have versions 3.10.1 and 3.10.2,
    then there are only bug fixes.

    but you should start with something simple that still works as a programmer’s
    editor.

- en: • A Terminal emulator. This is a text-based command interface to your computer.
    If you’ve ever seen a movie with hacking and programming in it, you’ve seen people
    furiously typing green text into a black screen so they can take down an entire
    alien race with their “unix exe 32 pipe attack.” At first you won’t need this,
    but later you’ll “graduate” to using the Terminal as it’s incredibly powerful
    and not too hard to learn.

    problem with installation instructions in books is they become outdated quickly.
    To solve this problem, I have a web page you need to visit with all of the instructions
    for your OS with videos showing you the installations. These instructions are
    updated whenever things change, and the web page includes any errata needed for
    your book.

    lpthw`.'

    your Terminal into that directory so your work is saved there.

- en: 4\. A “directory” is also called a “folder” on Windows and macOS. You can make
    the connection between the “directory” in your Terminal and the “folder” you normally
    see by typing `start.` on Windows or `open.` on macOS. This opens the current
    directory into a graphical folder window you’re used to normally seeing. If you’re
    ever lost, type that.

- en: 5\. The `start` command (`open` on macOS) works like double-clicking that thing
    with your mouse. If you are in the Terminal and want to “open” something, just
    use this command. Let’s say there’s a text file named `test.txt` and you want
    to open it in your editor. Type `start test.txt` on Windows or `open test.txt`
    on macOS.

- en: 6\. Now that you can open your Terminal and open things while in your Terminal,
    you’ll want to start your editor. This is Geany if you’ve been following instructions.
    Start it and create a file named `test.txt` and then save it in the `lpthw` directory
    you made. If you can’t find it, remember you can open it from the Terminal with
    `start` (`open` on macOS) and then use that folder window to find it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 7\. Once you’ve saved the file in the `lpthw` directory, you should be able
    to type `ls test.txt` in your Terminal to see that it’s there. If you get an error,
    then either you’re not in the `lpthw` directory and need to type `cd ~/lpthw`
    *or* you saved it in the wrong place. Try again until you can do this.

- en: 8\. Finally, in the Terminal, type `jupyter-lab` to start Jupyter and make sure
    it works. It should open your web browser, and then you’ll see the Jupyter app
    inside your browser. It’s kind of like a little website on your personal computer.

    watch the video for your OS where I show you how to do everything. I think the
    best way to learn this is to first attempt it yourself; then when you get stuck,
    watch the video to see how I did it.

    tasks, you might need to go through the [Command Line](https://learncodethehardway.com/command-line-crash-course/)
    Crash Course to learn the basics of the Terminal (also called the “command line”).
    You won’t need these skills for a while, but the command line is a very good introduction
    to controlling your computer with words. It will also help you with many other
    tasks in programming later, so learning it now can only help.
