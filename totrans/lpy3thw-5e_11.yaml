- en: By now you should realize the pattern for this book is to use more than one
    exercise to teach you something new. I start with code that you might not understand,
    and then more exercises explain the concept. If you don’t understand something
    now, you will later as you complete more exercises. Write down what you don’t
    understand, and keep going.

    each one.'
