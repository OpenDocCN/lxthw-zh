    `if-statement`. Type this in, make it run exactly right, and then we’ll see if
    your practice has paid off.

    to do it here to give you one more possible way to understand what’s going on.
    If `dis()` doesn’t really help you understand the code more, then feel free to
    do it and forget it.

    to identify the lines of Python code that match the byte codes.

    + 1` but involves less typing. You can call this the “increment by” operator.
    The same goes for `-=` and many other expressions you’ll learn later.'
