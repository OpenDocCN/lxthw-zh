- en: In [Exercise 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09) I threw you some new stuff just to keep you
    on your toes. I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple
    lines. In the first way, I put the characters `\n` (backslash `n`) between the
    names of the months. These two characters put a `new line character` into the
    string at that point.

- en: This `\` (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string.
    There are various “escape sequences” available for different characters you might
    want to use. We’ll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.

- en: An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote `'` or double-quote
    `"`. Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a double-quote
    inside the string. If you write `"I "understand" joe."` then Python will get confused
    because it will think the `"` around `"understand"` actually *ends* the string.
    You need a way to tell Python that the `"` inside the string isn’t a *real* double-quote.

- en: The second way to solve this problem is to use triple-quotes, which is just
    `"""` and works like a string, but you also can put as many lines of text as you
    want until you type `"""` again. We’ll also play with these.

    these, but memorize their format and what they do anyway. Try them out in some
    strings to see if you can make them work.

    Yes, keep going. Instead of stopping, take notes listing things you don’t understand
    for each exercise. Periodically go through your notes and see if you can figure
    these things out after you’ve completed more exercises. Sometimes, though, you
    may need to go back a few exercises and do them again.'
